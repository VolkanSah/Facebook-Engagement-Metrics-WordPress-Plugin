# Facebook Engagement Metrics (lite) WordPress Plugin 

This plugin displays Facebook engagement metrics for published links in the WordPress dashboard. 
  
If you need only the function in php or FB php-sdk use this: [Facebook Domain Metrics Checker]( https://github.com/VolkanSah/Facebook-Domain-Metrics-Checker)

## Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
2. Upload the ZIP file to your WordPress site via the Plugins page and activate the plugin.
3. Create a Facebook App to get the App ID and App Secret. You can follow the [Facebook Developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register/) to create a new app.
4. Go to the Facebook Engagement Metrics option page under Settings and enter your Facebook App ID and App Secret.

Please note that the initial installation may take some time, especially on shared hostings and larger websites. The plugin needs to fetch the engagement metrics for all published posts and pages that contain a link to a Facebook post.

## Usage

The plugin adds a dashboard widget that displays the number of likes, shares, and comments for each published post or page that contains a link to a Facebook post. The metrics are updated in real-time and are pulled from the Facebook Graph API.
